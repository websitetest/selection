This application is a tool for drawing selections in a Canvas element.
The Canvas element contains an Image that's used as a background. 
The Image is usually an air picture of buildings.
The user draws selections to mark specific spots in the air picture, like plots or the roof surfaces of buildings.
Selections are for sketching over the air image and not for exact calculations or perfect measurements of buildings.

I'll call the selection(s) in the Canvas "selection areas".

Every selection area is a Canvas on itself, containing handles to resize and rotate the selection area.
Later, it is also intended that the selection areas can be skewed.
A selection area should behave exactly the same as a rectangular selection in Microsoft Word, to illistrate the idea.

I thought this would be easy to implement, since it seemed easy to use the built in Transformations from the .NET framework.
